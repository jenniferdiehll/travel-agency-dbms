### üîå How it works: 
1. Create a connection with mysql database;
2. Run the API to create the developed tables/entities (automatically);
3. Open a platform to run API endpoints (**Collection available for download (Postman)**);
4. By running the endpoints, you will populate the database and obtain informations;
5. There are some scripts available to perform queries.
