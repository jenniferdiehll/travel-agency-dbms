### Context:
Project developed for the discipline of database II using technologies such as: Java, JPA, Spring Boot framework to create an API and a database with a scenario where there is at least one relationship of types 1:1, 1:N and N:N between the entities.

### 💻 Tecnologies: 
- Java : Object-oriented programming language
- JPA : Java Persistence API is a way to interact with relational databases using object-oriented principles
- Spring Boot Framework : A Java-based framework

- **MySQL Workbench:** It's tool developed by Oracle that provides a graphical user interface for managing and interacting with MySQL databases. MySQL Workbench is designed to help developers, database administrators, and other users to design, model, develop, and administer MySQL databases.  


### 🔌 How it works: 
1. Create a connection with mysql database
2. Run the api to create the tables/entities developed
3. Open a plataform to run API's endpoints (We used Postman - **Collection avaiable for download**)
4. Running the endpoints you will populate the database and get infos about consumer and purchase.
